\subsection{Rotational Matrices}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  A rotation in 3-D space (whose coordinates we will call X, Y, Z) is characterized by three angles. We will characterize them as a rotation around the x-axis, a rotation around the y-axis, and a rotation around the z-axis. \\
Derive the rotation matrix $R_1$ that transforms a vector $[x,y,z]^{T}$  to a new vector $[\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}]^{T}$ by rotating it counterclockwise by angle $\theta$ around the x-axis, then an angle $\delta$ around the y-axis, and finally an angle $\phi$ around the z-axis.\\
Derive the rotation matrix $R_2$ that transforms a vector $[x,y,z]^{T}$  to a new vector $[\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{z}]^{T}$ by rotating it counterclockwise by an angle $\delta$ around the y-axis, then an angle $\theta$ around the x-axis, and finally an angle $\phi$ around the z-axis.

\item Confirm that $R_1R_1^{T} = R_2R_2^{T} = I$
\end{enumerate}
