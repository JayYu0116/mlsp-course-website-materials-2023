			As mentioned in the Class Chanllenge Writeup, there will be a video presentation & peer review component to the final challenge. The video presentation is due on December 13th, 2022.
			Each student will be given a list of teams. You are responsible for watching the videos from those teams. A Google Form will be distibuted that you are responsible for filling out as part of the review. Additionally, you will need to ask at least one question on each of the Piazza posts from those teams. Since we will not be distributing the Google Form on this site, please keep on top of Piazza notifications. The peer review process will take place between December 14th, 2022 - December 15th, 2022.
